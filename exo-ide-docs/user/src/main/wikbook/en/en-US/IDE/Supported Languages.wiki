eXo IDE supports the following programming and scripting languages: JavaScript, HTML, XML, CSS, Java, Groovy, PHP, Ruby and JSP. Editing files in the IDE you have such editing functions as Syntax Highlighting, Code formatting, Code Autocompletion, Error Marking and Outliner. There are also preview mode for HTML, Javascript and Google gadget files. Finally IDE makes online development simple, providing deployment of your Java, PHP and Ruby applications to such cloud platforms (PaaS)as Heroku, Openshift and CloudBees out of the box.

h1. Java

For Java code available are Java Syntax Highlighting, Code Autocompletion, Code Formatting, Error Marking and Outliner. 

h2. Java Code Autocomplete.

h3. Object's Fields and Methods Autocompletion

You can also view JavaDoc and autocomplete the object's fields and methods as follows:
* *Step 1:* Print the instance name with the dot (.) at the end.
* *Step 2:* Press *Ctrl+Space* to view all public methods and fields of the object. The JavaDoc for the selected field or method is shown.

h1. Groovy

Groovy code is used for REST service and POGO files. The Editing functions are the same as for Java code.

h2. Groovy Code Specific Autocomplete List

Groovy is the Java based language, therefore Groovy code supports Java Autocomplete list with special features for Groovy. These features are for *REST Service* ("application/x-jaxrs+groovy"), *POGO* ("application/x-groovy") and *Data Object* ("application/x-chromattic+groovy"). The keywords of Groovy code are not marked with icons in the autocomplete list.  The autocomplete list varies, depending on Java types and is shown in the following cases:

* <local variable name>.
* <object's field name>.\_
* <static field name>.\_
* <method's parameter name>.\_
* <class name>.\_
* @<annotation name>\_
* in the line after the space.

IDE compiles classes, which are described in the project's classpath, before generation of _Autocomplete list_. If the compilation of some class is failed, the error message will appear in _Output Panel_ instead of *Autocomplete Form* as shown below:
{code}
[ERROR] Error (500: Internal Server Error)
startup failed, /ide-project/data/Pojo.groovy: 9: unexpected token: vpid @ line 9, column 3.
vpid fg(){
^
{code}
To display classes from folder, described as _folder source_ in the project's classpath, in the _Autocomplete Form_, the files with such classes should fulfill conditions as follows:

# Must be located in folder with respect to package structure.
# The name must be the same as the class name located in a file.
# Must have extension ".groovy" or ".grs".

h3. Class Name Autocomplete

You can view class's JavaDoc and class name from the autocomplete form. eXo IDE provides appropriate import statement into the file header automatically, if needed.
There is a list of default packages for the Groovy code:
* *java.lang.*\*
* *java.io.\**
* *java.math.BigDecimal*
* *java.math.BigInteger*
* *java.net.\**
* *java.util.\**
* *groovy.lang.\**
* *groovy.util.\**

h2. Code Outline for Groovy

In the _Outline Panel_ for the Groovy code of REST Service, ECM Template, POGO and Data Object files, you can see not only names and types of your classes, variables, methods, fields, or parameters, but also their modifiers and annotations in the view of icons and tooltips.
