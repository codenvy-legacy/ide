eXo IDE allows not only to create PHP, Java, Ruby and Ruby on Rails projects, but also provides all necessary tools for their easy deployment on Heroku, OpenShift and CloudBees PaaS.
Git is among the tools provided by the IDE, required for the successful deployment. Go to Git Version Control System and SSH keys chapters of the eXo IDE User Manual to learn more about Git usage.


h1. Heroku

Heroku is a free, cloud-based platform for Ruby application deployment. To deploy your Ruby and Ruby on Rails projects, do as follows:

* *Step 1:* Make sure you have registered an account at [http://heroku.com|http://heroku.com/]

* *Step 2:* In your left pane Site Explorer, select the folder you want to deploy to Heroku. The folder must be an initialized Git repository. If you are starting from a new folder, use Init Repository in the Git menu.

* *Step 3:* Go to *PaaS > Heroku > Create Application...* .

* *Step 4:* The location of the Git repository will be set by default with the folder you have selected. The application name will be used to identify the application on the Heroku server. Your application will be located at the URL: name.heroku.com
If you do not choose a name, a random name will be chosen for you. The remote repository name will be used to identify the Heroku remote in the Git menu. By default, the repository will be called "heroku".

* *Step 5:* Validate to create the new app. If the application creation is successful, you will see the URL, name and Git URL of your application in the Output console.

* *Step 5:* You can now create an application. Create a new folder and select it. In the OpenShift menu, choose Create Application. You will be asked to choose an application name and an application type. After validation, OpenShift will generate the default structure of your application in its remote repository. The repository will automatically be added to the list of remotes and named as "express".

* *Step 6:* To pull the application to your folder, make a Git Pull.

* *Step 7:* You can now modify your application. To update it on the OpenShift server, simply make a Git Add, Git Commit, and Git Push.

* *Step 8:* At all times, you can use the User Info menu to see the list of applications and their related information.

* *Step 4:* Put a check at Start After Creation box, if you want to deploy your application after build automatically, and click *Create*

You may be asked to log in to CloudFoundry if you haven't done it before, using *Switch Account* command of CloudFoundry menu. In the appeared window enter your email and password to proceed. You will be asked also to initialize your project folder as GIT repository. Click OK and monitor the application build. The messages about succesfull login and GIT repository creation will be displayed in the Output window.

* *Step 5:* The build status displays in the *Building* window. If it is successful, you will receive a message with your application domain.

!cloudbees-init.png|border=0!

*Illustration. Output message about application initialization*

* *Step 5:* We now need to push our code to a remote repository, in order to build it on Dev@Cloud. For this, we will use GitHub as an intermediary. Start by initializing a Git repository on your project (*Git > Initialize repository*).

* *Step 6:* If you haven't set up your GitHub account to work with your IDE yet, generate a new SSH key for [github.com|http://github.com/]and copy the public key to your GitHub account (Account Settings).

* *Step 7:* Create a new repository in GitHub and copy the SSH url.

* *Step 8:* Go to the IDE: *Git > Remote > Remotes...*, add GitHub as a remote repository and paste the SSH url.

* *Step 9:* Push your project to GitHub.

* *Step 10:* Go to your Cloudbees Jenkins dashboard ([https://yourname.ci.cloudbees.com/]) and create a new Job.

* *Step 11:* Choose a Job name, select Maven project and continue to the next screen.

*Illustration. Jenkins dashboard/New Job*


* *Step 12:* In the "Source Code Management" section, select Git. Insert the URL of the GitHub repository.

* *Step 13:* Copy the SSH public key that Cloudbees generated to your GitHub account (Account Settings).

* *Step 14:* In the "Post-build Actions" section, select Cloudbees Deployment and enter the Application Id that you had chosen when initializing the application.
