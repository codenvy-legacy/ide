            This an Action API how-to. You will find
            <strong>Actions menu</strong>
            on the toolbar above. There are also new icons on the toolbar, below Action menu. Finally, action items have been added to
            context menu (right click any file icon in the Project Explorer). There are two groups of action items:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Change visibility and availability:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            As the name suggests, it changes visibility and availability of items. Pressing this item will make one item invisible (it
            disappears) and one disabled (it becomes grayed out)
        </p>
        <p>
            When
            <strong>Change visibility and availability</strong>
            is called, the following code is executed:
        </p>
        <pre>
            SHOW_ITEM = !SHOW_ITEM;
        </pre>
        <p>
            You can view full code com.codenvy.ide.tutorial.action.action.ChangeItemAction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Visible Item:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pressing this icon will initiate an action - info box with item description. When
            <strong>Visible item</strong>
            is called, the following code is executed:
        </p>
        <pre>
            Window.alert("This is visible item!");
        </pre>
        <p>
            You can view full code com.codenvy.ide.tutorial.action.action.VisibleAction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Enable Item:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Identical to Visible item. When
            <strong>Enable item</strong>
            is called, the following code is executed:
        </p>
        <pre>
            Window.alert("This is enable item!");
        </pre>
        <p>
            You can view full code com.codenvy.ide.tutorial.action.action.EnableAction.
