/**
 * A "PropertyChange" event gets delivered whenever a bean changes a "bound"
 * or "constrained" property.  A PropertyChangeEvent object is sent as an
 * argument to the PropertyChangeListener and VetoableChangeListener methods.
 * <p/>
 * Normally PropertyChangeEvents are accompanied by the name and the old
 * and new value of the changed property.  If the new value is a primitive
 * type (such as int or boolean) it must be wrapped as the
 * corresponding java.lang.* Object type (such as Integer or Boolean).
 * <p/>
 * Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their
 * true values are not known.
 * <p/>
 * An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an
 * arbitrary set of if its properties have changed.  In this case the
 * old and new values should also be null.
